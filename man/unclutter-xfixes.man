== NAME

unclutter-xfixes - rewrite of unclutter using the X11-Xfixes extension

== SYNOPSIS

unclutter [--timeout <n>] [--fork|-b] [--help|-h] [--version|-v]

== OPTIONS

--timeout <n>::
Specifies the number of seconds after which the cursor should be hidden if
it was neither moved nor any button was pressed.

--fork|-b::
Fork unclutter to the background.

--help|-h::
Display the usage and exit.

--version|-v::
Display the version and exit.

== DESCRIPTION

Hide the mouse cursor if it isn't being used.

This version of unclutter is a rewrite of the original and uses the x11-xfixes
extension, which means that no fake windows or pointer grabbing is needed. This
should work better with window managers and applications.
